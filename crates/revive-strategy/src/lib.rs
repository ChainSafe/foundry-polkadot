//! This crate provides the Revive strategy for the Foundry EVM ExecutorStrategy.
//!
//! It is designed to work with the Revive runtime, allowing for the execution of smart contracts
//! in a Polkadot environment.
//!
//! It is heavily inspired from https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync/tree/main/crates/strategy/zksync
